<h6>Program 1: Currency Converter</h6>
<p>This program is a simple currency conversion system that allows users to convert a monetary value into three different currencies: the US dollar, the euro, and the British pound sterling. The program begins by setting the current exchange rates for each of these currencies. It then prompts the user to input the value they want to convert and choose the target currency. The program performs the conversion calculation and displays the result. If the user enters an invalid option, the program issues an error message indicating that the choice is not valid.</p>

<h6>Program 2: Login System</h6>
<p>This program is a basic login system designed to authenticate users through a predefined email and password. It starts by storing the correct email and password in variables. The user has three attempts to correctly input their email and password. After each unsuccessful attempt, the program informs the user that the credentials are incorrect and shows how many attempts they have left. If the user correctly enters their information within the three attempts, the program displays "Login successful!!" If the user fails to log in after three attempts, the program locks the user out, stating that the attempts have exceeded the allowed limit.</p>
